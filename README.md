Kratos is betrayed by Zeus, the king of the Olympian gods, who strips him of his godhood and kills him. Slowly dragged into the Underworld, he is saved by the Titan Gaia, who instructs him to find the Sisters of Fate, as they can allow him to time travel, prevent his betrayal, and get revenge on Zeus.
